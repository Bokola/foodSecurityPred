This folder contains all scripts necessary to run the machine learning model as described in the paper "Predicting Food-Security Crises in the Horn of Africa Using Machine Learning". 
It contains three folders: "input_data_scripts", "ML_model_scripts" and "Figures". These are the scripts required to pre-process ("clustering.py", "desert_locust.py", "FEWS_FSO.py", "Price_data_processing.py", "SST.py") and load the input data ("input_collector.py"), to execute the hyperparameter tuning ("HP_tuning.py") and the ML model ("ML_execution.py"), and to plot the results ("plots_paper.ipynb")


  This model is developed at the

  Institute for Environmental Studies
  Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Faculty of Science
  De Boelelaan 1111, 1081 HV Amsterdam
